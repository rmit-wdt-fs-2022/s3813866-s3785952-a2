We have completed the Pass (PA), Credit(CR) and, Distinction (DI) level of the assignment. 


**Things about the project** 
There are 3 project in the zip folder, "Assignment 2", "Assignment2APIs" and, "Assignment2ClassLirary". "Assignment 2" contains the code for Pass and Credit levels while 
"Assignment2APIs" contains the APIs required for Distinction. "Assignment2ClassLirary" is a class library that contains the model and utility methods that are used in the
other two projects.

In Distinction level, we do not have time to finish Admin portal. However we did finished implementing WebAPIs.

The documentation for the WebAPIs are in the form of comments.

**Things about the github repo**
In the "Pass PA" pull request, we did not include the confirmation page, this feature is part of the "Credit CR" pull request because we forgot to include it in "Pass PA" before moving on
